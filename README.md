# Intelligent Knowledge Management System

## Description
This project aims to create an intelligent knowledge management system that leverages AI to enhance information discovery, understanding, and utilization within an organization. It combines natural language processing, machine learning, and information retrieval techniques to create a powerful tool for managing and leveraging organizational knowledge.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Document Processing
- Automatic categorization and tagging of uploaded documents
- Extraction of key concepts and entities
- Generation of document summaries

### Semantic Search
- Natural language query understanding
- Context-aware search results
- Relevance ranking based on user behavior and document relationships

### Knowledge Graph Visualization
- Interactive visualization of relationships between documents, concepts, and people
- Dynamic exploration of knowledge connections

### AI-Powered Recommendations
- Personalized content suggestions based on user role, interests, and current tasks
- Identification of knowledge gaps and learning opportunities

### Automated Insights Generation
- Trend analysis across document corpus
- Identification of emerging topics and expertise within the organization

### Collaborative Knowledge Curation
- AI-assisted tagging and annotation
- Version control and change tracking for evolving knowledge

### Natural Language Querying
- Ability to ask questions in plain language and receive relevant answers
- Integration with chatbot interfaces for easy knowledge access

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Java with Spring Boot

### Frontend
- TypeScript with React

### AI/ML
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT models for NLP tasks

### Search
- Elasticsearch for efficient full-text search and analytics

### Database
- PostgreSQL for structured data

- Basic CRUD operations for documents and comments
- Tagging functionality for documents

### Pending Implementation
- Integration with NLP models for document processing
- Implementation of semantic search functionality
- Development of knowledge graph visualization
- AI-powered recommendation system
- Automated insights generation
- Collaborative knowledge curation features
- Natural language querying and chatbot integration
- Creation of user-friendly frontend with TypeScript and React for seamless interaction
